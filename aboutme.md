My name is Hristo Yankov and I'm a software engineer from [Bulgaria](https://www.google.bg/maps/place/Bulgaria/@42.7074842,23.2398427,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x40a8fec1c85bf089:0xa01269bf4c10?hl=en). I love learning (especially programming languages), challenges and prototyping and decided to build this site to share my progress.

Driven by curiosity I've switched several jobs covering different technological domains. As a young padawan I used to develop *almost* embedded software for [these babies](http://www.smartcom.bg/our-products/). [Smartcom](http://www.smartcom.bg) jumpstarted my carreer but the [dark side of the force](http://www.apple.com) found its way to me and I started practicing the dark mystic art of *iOS development* in [Minerva Jedi academy](http://www.minervanetworks.com) (to be honest it was a coincidence). Two years later, feeling strong enough, I decided I want more, brushed the dust off my old C++ lightsaber and joined the [enterprise world](http://www.comverse.com). However, that didn't work out great and now, mentored by the masters from the [Aviaso order](http://www.aviaso.com), I'm studying the darkest teaching of all ... JAVA!

Long story short, I'm more generalist than specialist. Ready for adventures and constantly hungry for knowledge! 

That's all for now but I'll do my best to keep the page up-to-date. *May the force be with you*!
