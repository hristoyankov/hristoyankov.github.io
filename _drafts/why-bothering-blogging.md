title: why bothering blogging
---

I've wanted to start a blog for quite some time. I've even had several attempts prior this one and considering writing a second sentence it's going way better than the last time!

Having zero experience in this area I had absolutely no idea where to start. Should I start writing about some technology I'm currently curious about or should I review the last book I read?! But none of this made sense to me... *"Who's that guy Hristo Yankov? Bulgaria? And why the hell is he talking about all those things he barely understands?"* ... Well my friend I'll that sounds like a nice title for the first post:


Why bothering blogging?
=======================

There're five main motivators behind having a dev/tech/geek blog.

I. Stuff I care about
---------------------

Writing software in excange for money costs a lot of my time and I rarely have the chance to work with technologies and tools I'm curious about. So the only option left is spending some of my free time exploring new topics and as far as I know the best measure of understanding something is having the ability to explain that thing simply. Some of the topics I'm currently curious about are:

- **Automation & DevOps**: including various fancy stuff like Docker, Vagrant, Kubernetes, Puppet, Chef; Unit / Acceptance / Behaviour testing; CI and CD and many mre.
- **Programming languages**: I love learning programming languages! However, "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing." (Alan Perils). To me it wasn't simply one language but the whole functional programming paradigm. It all started with (this course)[https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang] that I cannot recommend enough, done some Scala and finally fall in love with LISP. The main topic here will be Clojure and ClojureScript!
- **Building *good* habits** (like brushing your teeth or writing posts regularly).
- **Emacs** - the one editor to bring balance to the source.
- **Building scalable software** - a.k.a. use Clojure if you want to scale ;)
- ... and not only!

II. Self improvement
--------------------

English is not the native language here in Bulgaria and having and English blog is great opportunity to improve my vocabulary and writing skills. 

III. Missing CS foundations
---------------------------

IV. Personal projects
---------------------

V. Online prescense
